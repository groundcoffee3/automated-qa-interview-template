# Automated QA Challenge

## Overview
This coding challenge is designed to assess your skills in building automated tests to test a frontend application

This application fetches film data from the [StarWars api](https://swapi.dev/)

## Features
* Fetch and display a list of Star Wars films.
* Lists films on cards
* Responsive design for various screen sizes.
* Search bar to search for films by title.

## How to get started
Getting this repository running locally only requires a few steps.
* Make sure you have `Docker` and `docker-compose` installed
* Clone the repo
* Open a terminal
* run `docker-compose up` from the root directory 

## Project Structure
- **Frontend:** Angular application.
- **Backend:** NestJS application.

## Task Description
Your task is to write automated tests (E2E or Integration) that will test the quality of this application.

The tests can be written in any language you prefer.  That can be Selenium, Playwright, Cypress tests within this project, etc.

The idea is less to see the individual tests, but more to see how you think through the QA process, structure your tests, how you handle test data, how you handle test setup and teardown, etc.


## Submission

If creating a separate project (Selenium, Playwright, etc) to test, you can submit the project as a ZIP or create a repo and share the link with us

If writing Cypress tests within this project:
- Fork the project
- Commit the update code 
- Share the linkn with us
